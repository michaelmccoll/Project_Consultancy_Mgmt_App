PROJECT BRIEF:
The original brief, reflected the Vet Management App brief...
(https://github.com/codeclan/e47_classnotes/blob/main/week_04/day_4/projects/briefs/Vet_Management.md),
however once app development started, the brief was more closely aligned to the Gym Membership App brief...
https://github.com/codeclan/e47_classnotes/blob/main/week_04/day_4/projects/briefs/Vet_Management.md)

The Consultancy Management App covers the MVP's of both of these example briefs.
